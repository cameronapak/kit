## Comes With

- CSS-based component library (daisyUI)
- Blog
- Database ([Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/))
- Auth via [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), using the official Astro integration
- Simple Web Hosting (Netlify)

## Stack

### UI Layer

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A simple web metaframework.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling.
- [Preline UI](https://preline.co/) - Tailwind-based HTML components.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) - For a Bootstrap-like UI CSS component
  library, built upon Tailwind.
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) - For a beautiful icon library.

### Interactivity Layer

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety.
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) - For state management and interactivity.
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) - For sending HTML partials/snippets over the wire.

### Backend Data Layer

- [Astro DB](https://astro.build/db) - Astro DB is a fully managed SQL database
  that is fast, lightweight, and ridiculously easy-to-use. (Can use Turso, if
  desired.)
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - A modern SQL database toolkit.
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) - For authentication.

### Hosting

I have included the Netlify adapter in the starter kit. You can swap it out for
others, such as Vercel.

## How To Use

To create your own instance of this codebase, click the "Use this template"
button on the [repo's home page](https://github.com/cameronapak/freedom-stack).

## Environment Variables

This project uses the following environment variables:

| Variable                | Description                                | Required |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL`   | The connection URL to your libSQL server   | Required |
| `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN`    | The auth token to your libSQL server       | Required |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`      | Secret key for Clerk authentication        | Required |
| `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Publishable key for Clerk authentication   | Required |
| `SENTRY_DSN`            | Sentry Data Source Name for error tracking | Optional |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`     | Authentication token for Sentry            | Optional |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT`        | Sentry project identifier                  | Optional |

Make sure to set these variables in your environment or `.env` file before running the application.

### Astro DB Configuration (Required)

I recommend using [Turso](https://turso.tech/) for your database. Here's how you can connect it to Astro DB:

> You can now specify a libSQL server instance as the remote for @astrojs/db. This allows you to self-host your own libSQL server as an alternative to using Astro DB. This option works with any supported libSQL protocol.
>
> To use this feature, set the following environment variables:
>
> `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL`: the connection URL to your libSQL server.
>
> `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN`: the auth token to your libSQL server.
>
> You can also view/manage your database in the [libSQL Studio](https://libsqlstudio.com/).

### Sentry Configuration (Optional)

For Sentry error tracking, you can set up the following variables. For more information, refer to the [Sentry Astro integration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/#configure).

### Astro Studio

[Astro Studio is no longer supported.](https://astro.build/blog/goodbye-astro-studio/), but Astro DB isn't going anywhere.

## Vision

I dream of a lightweight, simple web development stack that invokes a fun web
experience at the cheapest possible maintainance, backend, and server cost. As
close to free as possible.

### Core Principles

- **Approachable** — I want those new to web development to feel comfortable
  using this stack. Things like database management should feel intuitive.
  Remove barriers of traditional JavaScript frameworks, such as excessive
  boilerplate code or intense state management. Go back to the basics of web
  development. (_While this is not vanilla, the dev experience will feel very
  natural._)
- **Flow-able** — Use an HTML-first approach, where almost all of the work is
  done on the DOM layer: styling, structuring, and interactivity. An opinionated
  stack helps you avoid analysis paralysis of trying to decide what tooling to
  pick or how to put things together. Instead, spend your thinking time
  building. This simple stack helps you focus and get in the flow of code
  faster. Fast setup. Fast building. Fast shipping.
- **Pocket-friendly** — Using this stack will be financially maintainable to
  anyone, especially indie hackers and those creating startup sites / web apps.
